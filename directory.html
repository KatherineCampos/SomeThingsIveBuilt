				Biography: 
			</p>
			<p align="justify">
			Katherine Campos is a first-year student of Computer Information Technology at Lethbridge College.  
			She is a Filipino Citizen currently on Permanent Residence Visa since May 2015.  Before coming to Canada, 
			she worked in Dubai for eight years and she worked there for various companies, where she obtained a lot of 
			skills and experiences.  Her husband moved in Canada in 2013 and because Canada has a good immigration system for 
			families, she and her daughter moved in Canada in 2014.  Starting a new life in a new place was not easy.  
			One of her colleague on one of her part-time jobs motivated her to go back to school.  Thus, given another 
			opportunity to go back to school is a life-changing experience for her, and she is very excited and hoping that 
			she can get through all of the challenges with confidence.
